# Dataset
MNIST digits classification dataset: https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/
# Goal
Use neural networks to classify handwriting images.
# P_01
1. Implement a simple one-layered neural network from scratch and then use Keras to model and train the exact same network.
2. Improve NN by using the ReLU activation functions, adding dropout to each layer. Furthermore, use L2 regularization for the training objective. Use cross-validation to select the best regularization and dropout hyperparameters.
3. Use Keras to model and train a simple convolutional network with one convolutional layer, one pooling layer, and one fully connected layer.
# P_02
See how SVM work in practice by playing with the sklearnâ€™s SVM implementation.
